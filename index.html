      <h1>You Look Like A Thing And I Love You</h1>
      <p class="title-subheading">"You Look Like a Thing and I Love You" is this awesome book by Janelle Shane that's all about artificial intelligence (AI) - you know, the stuff that powers things like Siri and self-driving cars. It's funny and approachable, with tons of examples of AI doing silly, unexpected things. At the same time, though, it doesn't shy away from the big questions about how AI is changing our world and what we should be doing to make sure it's used ethically. Even if you're not a tech expert, this book is a great way to learn more about AI and start thinking critically about it.</p>

        <p class="title-subheading">When people think of AI disaster, they think of AIs refusing orders,       deciding that their best interests lie in killing all humans, or creating terminator bots. But all those disaster scenarios assume a level of critical        thinking and a human-like understanding of the world that AIs won't be capable of for the foreseeable future.</p>

      <div class="flex-container-small">
      <p class="body-medium">Here’s how an AI disaster might actually play out today.

        Let’s say a Silicon Valley startup is offering to save companies time by screening job candidates, identifying the likely top performers by analyzing
        short video interviews. This could attractive—companies spend a lot of time and resources interviewing dozens of candidates just to find that one good match. Software never gets tired and never gets hangry, and it doesn’t hold personal grudges.

        But what are the warning signs that what the
        company is building is actually an AI disaster?

            instead, it produced cats with extra limbs, extra eyes, and weirdly distorted
            faces. Unlike the dataset of human pictures, which was made up of human
            faces seen from the front, the dataset of cat pictures included cats
            photographed from various angles, walking or curled up or meowing at the
            camera. It was too much for one

            three hundred different objects, even with people’s highly variable drawing
            ability. However, since Quick Draw only knew how to recognize those 345 things,

            that answering yes to any question that begins with “Do you see a…” would

            Show Visual Chatbot a blue apple, and it will answer the question

          <p class="body-medium">Among the community of AI researchers and enthusiasts, AI has a reputation for seeing giraffes everywhere. Given a random photo of an
            uninteresting bit of landscape—a pond, for example, or some trees—AI will
            tend to report the presence of giraffes.</p>

    <h3>Giraffing: Why does it happen?</h3>
  <div class="fifty">
    <p class="display-small">
        The reason for this has to do with the data the AI is trained on. Though
        giraffes are uncommon, people are much more likely to photograph a
        giraffe (“Hey, cool, a giraffe!”) than a random boring bit of landscape. The big free-to-use image datasets that so many AI researchers train their
        algorithms on tend to have images of lots of different animals, but few, if
        any, pictures of plain dirt or plain trees. An AI that studies this dataset will
        learn that giraffes are more common than empty fields and will adjust its
        predictions accordingly.

        It’s really tricky to come up with a goal that the AI isn’t going to

        is easier than what you want it to do.

        They don’t have
        common sense, and they don’t know when to ask for clarification. Give
        them a goal—data to imitate or a reward function to maximize (such as
        distance traveled or points collected in a video game)—and they’ll do it,

        <h1>Computer games are confusing</h1>
        <p class="title-subheading">In 2013, a researcher designed an algorithm to play classic computer
          games. When playing Tetris, it would place the blocks seemingly at
          random, letting them pile up nearly to the top of the screen. The algorithm
          would then realize that it would lose as soon as the next block appeared,
          and so it… paused the game forever. In fact, “pause the game so a bad thing won’t happen,” “stay at the very
          beginning of the level, where it’s safe,” or even “die at the end of level 1 so
          level 2 doesn’t kill you” are all strategies that machine learning algorithms
          will use if you let them.</p>

        <p class="title-subheading">Let’s say you want to use machine learning to create a robot that can walk.
          So you give an AI the task of designing a robot body and using it to travel
         from point A to point B. And it turns out that if you tell an AI to go from A to
         B and don’t tell it what to build, It assembles itself into a tower and falls over.</p>
